# lineExp
An expirement with lines and sockets


TODO for us:

1) Fix the code, to be clear - make everything generic, so we can change width of the drawings starting point and stuff
2) Add limits of board and collisions
3) Add fading of the line
4) Add more lines, a line per user
5) Sockets - make it online
